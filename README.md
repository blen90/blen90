## About Me

Hello! My name is Blenda, I'm originally from Guatemala, but I'm currently living in Austin, Texas.

I just received my Full Stack Web Development Certificate (Coding Boot Camp) from the University of Minnesota. This Bootcamp required an individual weekly effort ranging between 80-100+ hours in order to attend classes, complete real-world programming assignments, and collaborate on 3 group projects with other students. I have a Business and Finance background, I am bilingual in English and Spanish, and I have a newly discovered passion for coding.
